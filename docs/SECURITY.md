# Security

Status: pre-1.0, not independently audited. This document states what Nemo tries to guarantee and, deliberately, what it does not.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Do not open a public issue. Use GitHub private vulnerability reporting ("Security" tab, "Report a vulnerability") on the repository. TODO(owner): enable it and add a fallback contact address here before the first release. Include version (`nemo --version`), OS, and a reproduction. Expect acknowledgement on a best-effort basis; there is no bounty.

## Threat model

Assets: your files outside the workspace, your credentials, your network position. Adversaries considered:
1. **Prompt injection** from repository files, web pages, tool output, MCP servers, or the model itself. All of it is data, never instructions or permission grants.
2. **Malicious repository** (config, hooks, skills, MCP servers, build scripts) opened by a trusting user.
3. **Buggy or over-eager model** performing destructive actions.

Out of scope: a malicious local user or root, a compromised model provider, a hostile process that has already escaped the sandbox, kernel exploits, side channels. Nemo is not a container or VM.

## Trust model

- A permission gate sits before every tool call (ADR-007); model proposals do not grant privileges. Modes: `default`, `acceptEdits`, `plan`, `dontAsk`. Hooks fail closed. `bypassPermissions` (CLI flag, or the Shift+Tab confirmation dialog) skips prompts but still stops deny rules, ask rules, critical `rm` and destructive MCP asks; it does NOT stop plain writes to protected paths (`.git`, `.nemo`, `.ssh` ...), as in Claude Code, so rely on the sandbox there.
- **Project-level config, hooks, skills and MCP servers are untrusted by default**: files inside a repository can ask for execution, so they are not honoured as if you had written them. User-level config in `$NEMO_HOME` is trusted. See docs/specs/config.md for the exact layering.
- Child process environments (shell, hooks, MCP stdio) are an **allowlist** (PATH, HOME, locale, TERM, proxy and `SSL_CERT_*` variables, non-secret-shaped `NEMO_*`). API keys and tokens are never passed on. Only `{env:NAME}` references you write yourself, or explicit per-server env maps, add variables.
- Only `NEMO_*` variables are read for Nemo's own settings (`ANTHROPIC_*`/`OPENAI_*` are never read). Secrets are redacted from events, logs, transcripts and artifacts, and Debug output lists names only.
- Browser: isolated profile, URL policy, Chrome sandbox on unless a test hook disables it.

## Sandbox guarantees (commands run by the agent)

`Strong` = kernel-enforced boundary for that dimension. `Weak` = defence in depth against accidents and lazy attacks, **not** a boundary against a hostile process. `None` = not enforced. Taken from the backends' `capabilities()` in `crates/nemo-sandbox`; `nemo doctor` prints what your machine actually selected.

| OS / backend | Filesystem | Network (deny) | Process tree | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| macOS, Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`) | Weak | Weak | Strong | Deprecated by Apple, may break on any update. `--network loopback` exposes the HOST loopback (databases, Redis, docker TCP) and a 0.0.0.0 listener is LAN-reachable. |
| Linux, Landlock (helper `nemo-sandbox-exec`) | Strong with ABI >= 3, else Weak | Weak with ABI >= 4, else None | Strong | `--network loopback` unsupported. File metadata (stat) stays readable. |
| Linux, bubblewrap | Weak | Strong | Strong | Fresh network namespace; `loopback` is private to the sandbox. Needs unprivileged user namespaces. |
| Windows, Job Object | None | None | Weak | Only resource/process-tree containment. Treat as unsandboxed. |

`--network allow` restricts nothing. Per-host allowlists are unsupported on every backend and rejected. With `--sandbox enforce` (default) Nemo refuses to run a command it cannot confine to at least `Weak`; `best-effort` and `off` run unconfined and warn loudly. On Windows nothing can confine a command, so when `--sandbox` is NOT given the default is `best-effort` with a loud one-line notice at start (`sandbox: this OS has no command confinement ... UNCONFINED`) instead of refusing every command; `--sandbox enforce` still refuses them. macOS and Linux keep `enforce` as the default (owner decision D10, 2026-10-28); check `nemo doctor`.

**Read-only inside the writable workspace.** Besides `.git/hooks` and `.git/config`, the standard policy makes `.git/modules`, `.gitmodules`, `.nemo/` (project settings: hooks, MCP, agents, skills), `NEMO.md` and `AGENTS.md` read-only, so a sandboxed command cannot plant configuration or instructions that the next trusted session would load. The Write/Edit tools judge the same names as protected paths. Seatbelt enforces these even when the path does not exist yet; bubblewrap only for paths that exist (a missing `.nemo/` can still be created by a command on Linux); the Windows backend has no filesystem confinement. Side effect: `git submodule update` and similar writes to `.git/modules` fail inside the sandbox.

**Linux requirement for `--sandbox enforce`.** The standard policy makes `.git/hooks` and `.git/config` read-only inside the writable workspace. Landlock cannot express a read-only path inside a writable root and rejects that policy, so on Linux `enforce` needs **bubblewrap** (`bwrap`) with unprivileged user namespaces. With Landlock alone `nemo doctor` prints `enforce_ready: no (...)` and `nemo run` exits 2; Enforce is not weakened. On Ubuntu 24.04+ AppArmor restricts unprivileged user namespaces: either `sudo sysctl -w kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=0`, or an AppArmor profile that lets `/usr/bin/bwrap` create them. Otherwise run with `--sandbox best-effort` (commands run unconfined). `nemo doctor` reports `enforce_ready: yes|no (reason)` by dry-running the same preflight as `nemo run`. On Linux the bubblewrap check is a real probe: `bwrap` runs `/bin/true` with the exact argument set used for commands (user/pid/ipc/net namespaces, `--proc /proc`, `--dev /dev`, tmpfs, read-only root bind), once per process, so `enforce_ready: yes` means a command will start. When it fails, doctor and the `nemo run` refusal print bwrap's own error and a remedy (inside Docker, where `/proc` is masked: `--security-opt systempaths=unconfined`; blocked user namespaces: the sysctl/AppArmor fixes above). Backends are tried bubblewrap, then Landlock, then none. `enforce` uses the first and refuses with its reason; `best-effort` degrades to the next backend that accepts the policy, finally to unconfined, printing one `WARNING ... UNCONFINED (unsandboxed_by_request)` line to stderr and flagging every such result `sandbox: null, unsandboxed_by_request: true`. Limit: only the policy-independent argument set is probed; a failure specific to one policy (for example a bind of a path that disappears) still surfaces as that command's own error, not as a fallback.

## Data retention

Everything is local under `$NEMO_HOME` (default `~/.nemo`): settings, session transcripts (`projects/<cwd>/<session>.jsonl`, written while `compat.write_node_transcripts` is on), the SQLite store `nemo.db`, and artifacts under `sessions/<id>/artifacts/`. Transcripts contain your prompts, file contents the agent read, and command output, with known secret shapes redacted (best effort, not a guarantee). There is no telemetry and no retention cleanup yet: delete the files to delete the data. Nemo writes no credentials to disk; the legacy plaintext `auth.json` of the Node CLI is not carried over. Prompts and tool results are sent to the model provider you configure.

## Supply chain

CI runs cargo-deny (licenses, bans, sources, advisories) and cargo-audit. Release archives, `SHA256SUMS` and the installers carry GitHub build provenance attestations, plus a CycloneDX SBOM. The `test-provider` feature (scripted fake model) is a compile error in release profiles and is checked absent from every release binary.

Release pipeline controls (all UNVERIFIED on GitHub until the first release runs; details and owner setup in docs/RELEASE.md):
- Every `uses:` is pinned to a full commit SHA; the release `gate` job runs `scripts/check-action-pins.mjs` and fails otherwise. Dependabot proposes updates.
- The tagged commit must be an ancestor of `origin/main`, and the tag must be annotated with a signature GitHub reports as verified, named exactly as the pushed tag, and pointing at the commit being built (`scripts/check-release-tag.sh`, run in `gate` and again in `release` right before the draft is created with `--target $GITHUB_SHA`; a draft is deleted if the tag moved during creation). Caveat: "Verified" means signed by a key of any GitHub account, so any account allowed to push tags passes. `.github/release-maintainers.txt` is an allowlist of tagger emails and the check FAILS CLOSED: a missing or empty list refuses the release unless the repository variable `NEMO_ALLOW_ANY_VERIFIED_TAGGER` is exactly `true` (explicit owner risk acceptance). Also restrict tag creation and block tag updates with a ruleset, and enable immutable releases. Publishing is a separate `publish` job in the `release` environment that re-runs the tag check and verifies the draft's `targetCommitish` equals the built commit before `gh release edit --draft=false`. The `release`/`publish` checkouts do not persist the token.
- Signing certificates are ENVIRONMENT secrets of the `release` environment (required reviewers, tag-restricted), never repository secrets. Build, attest and release jobs run in that environment. `id-token`/`attestations` write is granted to the `attest` job only; `contents: write` to the `release` job only. Release builds use no build cache.
- Workflows trigger on `push` (branches/tags), `pull_request` (no secrets, read-only token) and `schedule`; there is no `pull_request_target` and no `workflow_run`. User-controlled values (tag, ref names) reach shell only through `env:`.
- Installers: https only (`--proto '=https' --tlsv1.2`), version allow-list, sha256 check, and `gh attestation verify` of `SHA256SUMS` by default; they fail closed when `gh` is missing (`NEMO_SKIP_ATTESTATION=1` accepts checksum-only with a loud warning), pin the attestation to the `release.yml` signer workflow and to `refs/tags/v<version>`, and refuse to run with the `OWNER` placeholder repository (`scripts/check-placeholders.mjs` also gates the release).

Limits: a pinned SHA fixes which code runs, not that it is good; review Dependabot bumps. With `NEMO_SKIP_ATTESTATION=1` the installers authenticate nothing beyond TLS to GitHub. The attestation proves the artifacts were built by `release.yml` of the repository, not that the source is benign.

## Artifacts are raw

Command logs and `tool-results/` artifacts hold the tool's output UNREDACTED (redaction applies to events, not to these files). The `tool-results` directory is created 0700 and its files 0600 on unix; on Windows rely on the profile ACLs. Treat the artifact root like the working tree: do not share or upload it unreviewed.

## Known gaps

No independent security audit; Windows has no filesystem/network confinement; Seatbelt is deprecated; secret redaction is pattern-based; macOS/Windows signing depends on owner-provided certificates (docs/RELEASE.md).
