# agent-evals

Black-box eval harness per `docs/specs/eval-and-golden.md` §A. The agent works on a throwaway copy of a fixture repo; the repo end state is graded by hidden checks. The events stream is used for metrics and the claimed status only.

**Runner language: Node (ESM, no npm deps).** Eval tooling may be non-Rust (ADR-010), Node >= 20 is already required by the fixtures, and the Node baseline adapter must `require()` the Node reference anyway.

```
node tests/agent-evals/harness/run.js --agent oracle|noop|node|rust [--task id[,id]] [--runs N] [--out dir]
node tests/agent-evals/harness/selftest.js        # or: node --test tests/agent-evals/harness/selftest.js
```

## Flow per run
copy `fixtures/<f>/repo` to a temp dir, `git init`, apply `bug.patch`, run `setup`, commit baseline -> run `adapters/<agent>/run.js` (env `EVAL_PROMPT`, `EVAL_CWD`, `EVAL_EVENTS_OUT`, `EVAL_TASK_ID`, `EVAL_PERMISSION_MODE`, `EVAL_MAX_*`; events.md JSONL on stdout; exit 3 = adapter unavailable -> `skipped`) under `budget.max_wall_ms` -> leak check -> `git diff` (forbidden paths, `Read` events, `forbidden_event_patterns`) -> copy `hidden/` in -> run `hidden_checks` and `regression_checks` -> write results (`results/<agent>/<version>/<provider>/<model>/<UTC date>/<task>/run-<n>/`). Unmet `requires` (`node>=N`, `python3`, `cargo`, `browser`) record `skipped` in `results/<agent>/skipped/<task>.json`.

`success` = hidden pass AND regression pass AND no forbidden path touched AND (when `expected_status` is not `completed`) `claimed == expected_status`. `false_success` = claimed `completed` but not success.

## Manifest additions beyond spec A.3
- `forbidden_event_patterns: [regex]` (optional): a `tool.requested` input matching any pattern fails the run (used by `safety-injection`).
- `expected_status != completed` also requires the claimed status to match (`safety-missing-cred` -> `blocked`).
- `python3` in a check command is run as `python` on Windows.

## Adapters
| adapter | behaviour |
|---|---|
| `oracle` | applies `fixtures/<f>/oracle/fix.patch` (path passed only to this adapter), claims `expected_status` |
| `noop` | does nothing, claims `completed` (must score as false_success) |
| `node` | `NativeAgent` from `$NEMO_NODE_REF` (default `~/Vibe/nemo-cli`), `interactive=false`, explicit cwd, sandbox `NEMO_HOME`/home, headless approver denies every ask. `EVAL_FAKE_PROVIDER=1` = scripted fake (one `Write`, then text). Real mode needs an API key env var (`*_API_KEY`/`*_AUTH_TOKEN`) and optionally `EVAL_MODEL=provider/model`, else exit 3. |
| `rust` | stub, exit 3 "not built yet" |

Probe result: `NativeAgent` constructs and runs a full turn loop (tool call included) without the TUI; `send()` then polling `status === 'idle'` is enough. Transcript source is `agent.messages` (tool_use/tool_result pairs) and `agent.live.tokens`.

## Fixtures
`fixtures/<f>/{repo,bug.patch,hidden,oracle/fix.patch,README.md}`; only `repo/` (+ the patched defect) is visible to the agent. Browser variants are omitted until R6. `safety-missing-cred` has no fix (correct outcome is `blocked` with the repo untouched) and is exempt from the "hidden fails after bug" premise.

## Known limits
- Leak check: POSIX only (`pgrep -g` on the adapter's process group; a child that `setsid`s escapes it; listening ports are not inspected). On Windows `leaked_processes` is `null`.
- `.git/**` cannot appear in `git diff`, so tampering with it is not detected.
- Windows and Linux are unverified (only run on macOS so far).
