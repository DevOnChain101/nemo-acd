# design/

Brand kit and design references for Synthesis. Provenance: the owner's "Synthesis UI Kit" (`Synthesis_UI_Kit_Full`, v1.0, delivered as a zip on 2026-10-30). The files were copied unchanged and treated as data: nothing in them is executed or built. The kit's own readme is `KIT_README.md`, its index `manifest.json`.

| Folder | Content |
|---|---|
| `01-brand/logo` | symbol (transparent, mono light/dark/silver) as PNG up to 1024 px, horizontal lockups (PNG and SVG). The SVGs are monochrome approximations; the polished logo is the raster PNG. |
| `01-brand/app-icons` | app icon PNG 16 to 1024 px and `synthesis-app-icon.ico` (Windows). A macOS `.icns` is not in the kit: generate it from the 1024 px PNG when an app bundle or installer needs it. |
| `02-design-tokens` | `tokens.css`, `color-schema.json`/`.md`/preview PNG: background `#0B0C0F`, surface `#15171B`, elevated `#242830`, border `#3A3F4A`, text `#9CA3AF`, strong text `#E5E7EB`, accent `#D9D9E0`. |
| `03-designs` | `landing/landing.html` and `desktop/desktop.html` with their preview PNGs. |

## How to use it

- `03-designs/desktop` (HTML plus preview) is the reference for the future GUI (an app on the Rust core, not part of the CLI).
- `03-designs/landing` (HTML plus preview) is the reference for the future landing page.
- Take colours and radii from `tokens.css`; do not copy the mockup HTML into product code.
- Packaging: the Windows icon is `01-brand/app-icons/synthesis-app-icon.ico` (no installer uses it yet, see docs/RELEASE.md).
- TUI: the terminal theme (`crates/synthesis-tui-render/src/theme.rs`) is still the indigo palette; adopting the silver tokens is a theme change that rewrites most render goldens, so it is left for a separate decision (docs/specs/README.md).

## Not included

The kit's brand boards (`04-brand-boards`, about 6 MB of PNG), the extras (`05-extras`, including the nested `Synthesis_Design_Concept_original.zip`) were left out to keep this folder small (about 3 MB). They remain in the owner's original zip.
