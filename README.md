# Synthesis

Synthesis is a model-agnostic autonomous coding agent written in Rust. It runs a plan, act, observe, verify loop against your repository, talks directly to Anthropic-compatible and OpenAI-compatible APIs, and confines the commands it runs in an OS sandbox.

Status: **pre-1.0 (0.1.0 draft)**. See [Status and limitations](#status-and-limitations) before relying on it.

## Install

Pick one (details in [docs/INSTALL.md](docs/INSTALL.md)):

```sh
# macOS / Linux: checksum + provenance verified (provenance needs gh, else checksum only with a warning), no sudo, installs to ~/.local/bin
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -fsSL https://github.com/DevOnChain101/nemo-acd/releases/latest/download/install.sh | sh
# any OS with Node >= 18: native binary via platform packages
npm install -g @devonchain101/synthesis   # installs the command `synth`
```

Windows (PowerShell 7+): `irm https://github.com/DevOnChain101/nemo-acd/releases/latest/download/install.ps1 | iex`. Release archives, SHA256SUMS and build provenance are on the GitHub Releases page. License: Apache-2.0.

## Quick start

Synthesis uses API keys only (ADR-011): no subscription login, no keychain, nothing written to disk. Keys come from `SYNTHESIS_*` environment variables (no other variable prefix is read; other names only via an explicit `{env:NAME}` reference in your provider config).

```sh
export SYNTHESIS_API_KEY=...             # see docs/specs/config.md for the full list
                                    # (SYNTHESIS_ANTHROPIC_API_KEY, SYNTHESIS_AUTH_TOKEN, SYNTHESIS_BASE_URL, SYNTHESIS_MODEL, ...)
synth doctor --cwd .                 # sandbox backend, shell, browser, git, config, proxy, legacy-name and PATH-shadowing hints
synth models                         # configured models
synth run --cwd . --model provider/model --prompt "fix the failing test in src/parser"
```

`synth run` is headless: events are JSON lines on stdout (schema in `docs/specs/events.md`). `--cwd` is required; Synthesis never uses an implicit working directory. Budgets: `--max-turns`, `--max-tool-calls`, `--max-cost-usd`, `--max-wall-secs`. `--permission-mode default|acceptEdits|plan|dontAsk`.

## Sandbox and network

Commands the agent runs are confined by the OS where possible.

| flag | values | default |
|---|---|---|
| `--sandbox` | `enforce` (refuse to run if the command cannot be confined), `best-effort`, `off` (loud warning) | `enforce` |
| `--network` | `deny`, `loopback` (dev server + tests in one sandbox), `allow` (loud warning) | `deny` |
| `--sandbox-read PATH` | extra read-only path. Toolchains under `$HOME` (`~/.rustup`, `~/.cargo`, `~/.nvm`, `~/.npm`, `~/.pyenv`, `~/.asdf`, `~/.local`, `~/.config`, volta/bun/deno/fnm/rbenv/sdkman, Linuxbrew) are readable by default, except credential files and dirs (`~/.ssh`, `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.config/gh`, `~/.cargo/credentials*`, browser profiles, keychains, `.env*`/`*.pem`/`*.key` entries) | none |

Backends: Seatbelt (macOS), Landlock or bubblewrap (Linux), Job Object only (Windows, no filesystem or network confinement). Most guarantees are **Weak**, meaning defence in depth, not a security boundary. Read [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md) for the per-OS table.

## Security model in brief

Model output, repository files, web pages and tool output are untrusted data. A permission gate sits before every tool call. Project config, hooks, skills and MCP servers from a repository are untrusted until you trust them. Subprocess environments are filtered by an allowlist. Full detail and vulnerability reporting: [docs/SECURITY.md](docs/SECURITY.md).

## Coexisting with the Node CLI

During the parallel run both CLIs can be installed. See [docs/MIGRATION.md](docs/MIGRATION.md).

## Status and limitations

- Not yet run end to end on GitHub CI, Linux or Windows by the maintainers; release pipeline and signing are unverified until the first tag.
- Windows has no filesystem or network sandbox; macOS Seatbelt is deprecated by Apple and best-effort.
- Eval parity with the Node CLI against real models is not yet measured (cutover gate).
- TUI, durable sessions and worktrees are incomplete; see `docs/STATUS.md`.

## Development

```sh
cargo fmt --all --check
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo test --workspace --features synthesis-cli/test-provider
node tests/agent-evals/harness/selftest.js
```
